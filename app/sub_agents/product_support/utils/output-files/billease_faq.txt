question: What is an annuity?
answer: An annuity is a fixed-installment consumer loan where you repay the borrowed amount through equal monthly installments (EMIs) over a set term. Each payment consists of both principal and interest, with the interest portion decreasing over time as you pay down the principal balance. This structure ensures that your monthly payments remain predictable while gradually reducing the overall interest cost.

---
question: How is an annuity loan different from other loan types?
answer: An annuity loan follows a method of interest accrual on declining balance, meaning your monthly payment stays constant, but the interest portion decreases as more of each payment goes toward the principal. Unlike other loans where interest might be front-loaded or fixed, annuity loans offer a predictable repayment schedule while allowing you to reduce the balance by prepaying over scheduled minimum payment, which reduces next payment interest accruals and eventually lower total overpayment amount.

---
question: Can I use the annuity loan for any type of purchase?
answer: Annuity loans are available for purchases from select merchant partners. Eligible transactions may include electronics, appliances, and other consumer durables, depending on the partnership agreements with merchants. You'll see annuity as an option after scanning BillEase QR.

answer: To be eligible for an annuity loan, you must be an active BillEase user with a good repayment history and meet the necessary credit assessment criteria. Eligibility may also depend on the specific merchant partner and purchase type.

---
question: How does an annuity loan impact my credit score?
answer: Timely repayment of your annuity loan can positively impact your credit score, making it easier for you to qualify for larger BillEase loans in the future. However, missed or late payments may negatively affect your credit profile and penalty may apply.

---
question: How much can I avail using BillEase's annuity loan?
answer: You can avail of an annuity loan based on your personal credit limit and individual Merchant settings. Some merchants might not support annuity products.

---
question: What are the standard loan terms?
answer: The standard loan term is up to 24 months, consisting of 24 equal monthly installments. Each installment follows a predetermined repayment schedule, ensuring a consistent and manageable payment plan.

---
question: How is interest calculated on this loan?
answer: Interest is calculated as a monthly rate according to the contract multiplied by the rest of balance for the following month.

---
question: What is a "declining balance" interest calculation?
answer: A declining balance interest calculation means that interest is charged only on the remaining principal balance. As you make payments, your principal reduces, causing interest charges to decrease over time. This method helps lower the total interest paid over the life of the loan.

---
question: What is a "flat rate" in loan terms?
answer: A flat rate is an alternative way to express loan costs, where total expected interest and fee amount is divided by the number of contracted months. It is an alternative and simple way to understand the monthly cost of loan for a given term, also used to compare rates of different products and providers.

---
question: What fees are included in the loan?
answer: The loan includes a processing fee that covers underwriting and loan processing costs, as well as legally authorized charges outlined in your Promissory Note and Disclosure Statement (PNDS). Additionally, the processing fee is incorporated into the loan amount to ensure transparency in cost structure.

---
question: Are there any hidden charges?
answer: No, there are no other charges. All fees and charges are clearly outlined and disclosed in the Loan Agreement (PNDS) before loan approval.

---
question: Can I make extra payments?
answer: Yes, you can make payments above your scheduled EMI. Extra payments are applied directly to the principal, which helps reduce total interest costs and may shorten the loan term. Making additional payments allows you to pay off your loan faster while saving on interest expenses.

---
question: Are there penalties for early full repayment?
answer: No, there are no penalties for early repayment. You can repay your loan in full or make excess payments at any time, reducing your total interest cost and potentially shortening your loan term.

---
question: How do overpayments affect my loan?
answer: When you make overpayments, the outstanding principal balance is reduced, which in turn decreases future interest charges. Overpayments may also shorten your loan term, and best of all, they do not incur any additional fees.

---
question: How can I track my loan or principal balance?
answer: After successful repayment and after the due date, BillEase will send you an updated Amortization Schedule, as explained in the Promissory Note and Disclosure Statement. You will receive this schedule via email, and it will also be accessible in the app, allowing you to track your loan progress conveniently.

---
question: What happens if I miss a payment?
answer: If you miss a payment, late payment penalties may apply, and your credit score could be affected. It is important to contact customer service immediately to discuss available options and avoid additional charges or negative impacts on your credit profile.

---
question: Can I request a payment extension?

---
question: What should I do if I have trouble repaying my loan?
answer: If you experience financial difficulties, reach out to BillEase customer support as soon as possible to discuss repayment alternatives or restructuring options to help manage your obligations effectively.

---
question: Can I apply for another loan while repaying this one?
answer: Eligibility for another loan while repaying an existing one depends on your repayment history, overall creditworthiness, remaining limit, and individual financial assessment. BillEase evaluates each application based on these factors before approving additional credit.

---
question: What happens when I finish repaying my loan?
answer: Once your loan is fully repaid, you will receive a confirmation, and your account will reflect a zero balance. Successfully completing a loan strengthens your credit history, making you eligible for better loan offers in the future.

---
question: With Easypace, I understand that advance payments are applied to the principal rather than the next installment. Does this mean that if I make a payment before my due date, I am still required to pay on the exact due date? For example, if my due date is tomorrow but I make a payment today, will I still need to pay tomorrow?
answer: Any payment made before the due date will be held and applied to the next scheduled installment first, with any excess allocated to the principal. Once a payment is made, the schedule is adjusted accordingly. If a past-due payment includes an overpayment, the system will allocate the funds appropriately, including applying any extra amount to the principal.
